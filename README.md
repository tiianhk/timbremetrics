# Timbre Metrics

Measure how well your model’s audio embeddings match human timbre perception using 21 published datasets with audio files and their pairwise (dis)similarity ratings.

Below, human (dis)similarity ratings from three datasets are visualized as triangular matrices. Each point corresponds to a unique audio pair. A darker color indicates that the sounds are judged to be more similar by human listeners.

These values represent perceptual timbre similarity, as in nearly all cases, paired sounds are controlled to have the same pitch, loudness, and duration.

## Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/tiianhk/timbremetrics.git
```

## Usage
```
from timbremetrics.metrics import TimbreMetric

metric = TimbreMetric(model)

evaluation_results = metric()
```
