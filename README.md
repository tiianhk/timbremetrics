# Timbre Metrics

Measure how well your modelâ€™s audio embeddings match human timbre perception using 21 published datasets with audio files and their pairwise (dis)similarity ratings.

Below, human (dis)similarity ratings from three datasets are visualized as triangular matrices. Each point corresponds to a unique audio pair. A darker color indicates that the sounds are judged to be more similar by human listeners.

These values represent perceptual timbre similarity, as in nearly all cases, paired sounds are controlled to have the same pitch, loudness, and duration.

## Installation
Run
```
pip install git+https://github.com/tiianhk/timbremetrics.git
```
or, to install as an editable package
```
git clone https://github.com/tiianhk/timbremetrics.git
cd timbremetrics
pip install -e .
```
If you want to run python scripts in the `examples/` folder to evaluate pre-trained models like CLAP and DSP features such as MFCCs, use `[extra]` to include extra dependencies:
```
pip install -e .[extra]
```
Python version 3.11.6 is recommanded if loading pre-trained models with [fadtk](https://github.com/microsoft/fadtk).

## Usage
A minimal example
```
from timbremetrics import TimbreMetric

# initialization and data loading
metric = TimbreMetric()

# compute the metrics
results = metric(model)

print(results)
```
Some options
```
# load data to gpu
metric = TimbreMetric(device='cuda')

# the default sample rate is 44100 Hz, you can change it to suit your model
metric = TimbreMetric(sample_rate=48000)

# audio length is different, you can pad audio to the max length of one dataset
metric = TimbreMetric(pad_to_max_duration=True)

# you can pad or truncate all audio to a fixed duration
metric = TimbreMetric(fixed_duration=2.0)
```
The `model` should be a Callable (functions, methods, lambdas, objects that implement the `__call__` method) and is used to produce embeddings for audio tensors of shape `(1, num_samples)`.
Output tensors should have the same shape so their pairwise distances can be computed.

See [here](timbremetrics/metrics.py#L86-L107) for more options to initialize an object using the `TimbreMetric` class. Check the files in `examples/` for examples.
