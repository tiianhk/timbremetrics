# Timbre Metrics

Measure how well your modelâ€™s audio embeddings match human timbre perception using 21 published datasets with audio files and their pairwise (dis)similarity ratings.

Below, human (dis)similarity ratings from three datasets are visualized as triangular matrices. Each point corresponds to a unique audio pair. A darker color indicates that the sounds are judged to be more similar by human listeners.

These values represent perceptual timbre similarity, as in nearly all cases, paired sounds are controlled to have the same pitch, loudness, and duration.

## Installation
Run
```
pip install git+https://github.com/tiianhk/timbremetrics.git
```
or, to install as an editable package
```
git clone https://github.com/tiianhk/timbremetrics.git
cd timbremetrics
pip install -e .
```
If you want to run python scripts in the `examples/` folder to evaluate pre-trained models like CLAP and DSP features such as MFCCs, use `[extra]` to include extra dependencies:
```
pip install -e .[extra]
```
Especially, Python version 3.11.6 is recommanded if loading pre-trained models with [fadtk](https://github.com/microsoft/fadtk).

## Usage
A minimal example
```
from timbremetrics import TimbreMetric
metric = TimbreMetric()
results = metric(model)
print(results)
```
The `model` should be a Callable and is used to produce embeddings of audio tensors of shape `(1, num_samples)`.
Output tensors should have the same shape so their pairwise distances can be computed.

See [here](timbremetrics/metrics.py#L86-L107) for arguments to initialize the metric. Check the files in `examples/` for examples.
